I am currently working as a Principal Analyst at the [National Environment Agency (NEA)](https://www.nea.gov.sg), Singapore, where my research focuses on understanding the ecology of Wolbachia-infected mosquito populations and assessing the impact of Wolbachia interventions on dengue transmission dynamics in Singapore.
Prior to this, I was a Research Fellow at the [Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health (SSHSPH)](https://sph.nus.edu.sg/), NUS.

My research interests lie in infectious disease modelling and statistical inference, with a particular focus on estimating the effective reproduction number (R<sub>t</sub>) across different epidemiological contexts and understanding the role of human mobility in shaping transmission dynamics. I apply mathematical and statistical modelling approaches to address policy-relevant public health questions. My academic training began in complex dynamical systems, and I later transitioned into infectious disease modelling, bridging theory with applied public health research.

Please feel free to reach out. I would be happy to collaborate on projects aligned with my research interests.
