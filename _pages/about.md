I am working as a principal analyst at the [National Environment Agency (NEA)](https://www.nea.gov.sg), where I am trying to understand the ecology of Wolbachia mosquito popultaion, and also the effect of Wolbacia mosquitoes on the Dengue dynamics for Singapore. Before that, I was a Research Fellow at the [Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health (SSHSPH)](https://sph.nus.edu.sg/), National University of Singapore. 

My research interest focuses on infectious disease modelling and inference, including estimation of R<sub>t</sub> across different contexts and the role of human mobility in shaping transmission dynamics. I use mathematical and statistical methods to address policy-relevant questions. I began my research in complex dynamical systems and later transitioned to infectious-disease modelling.


Feel free to reach out, I would be happy to collaborate on projects aligned with my interests.
