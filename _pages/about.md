I am a Research Fellow at the [Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health (SSHSPH)](https://sph.nus.edu.sg/), National University of Singapore. My current work focuses on infectious disease modelling and inference, including estimation of R<sub>t</sub> across different contexts and the role of human mobility in shaping transmission dynamics. I use mathematical and statistical methods to address policy-relevant questions. I began my research in complex dynamical systems and later transitioned to infectious-disease modelling.
Feel free to reach out, I would be happy to collaborate on projects aligned with my interests.
