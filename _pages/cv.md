Education
======
* Ph.D in Applied mathematics, University of Calcutta, 2017-2021
   * Thesis Title: Emergent Properties of Collective Neuronal Systems.
   * During my Ph.D., I tried to understand collective behaviour of neuronal systems from a dynamical system perspective. In the process of neuronal activity, different dynamics such as steady state, chaos, oscillation appears at individual level, and also collectively different synchronizing phenomena like complete, lag, partial, explosive etc. I used various dynamical system approach to understand the global behaviour of the whole system made by individual level dynamics. I also used the reservoir computing, a RNN based machine learning approach commonly used in physics to predict dynamics of a system, to predict the collective dynamics of a neuronal systems.
* M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics, University of Calcutta, 2014
* B.Sc. in Mathematics, Bethune College, University of Calcutta, 2012

Work experience
======
* Research Fellow, 2022
  * Department of Physics, Central University of Rajasthan
  * I used Reservoir Computing to the predict various dynamics of a system. Based only on the parameter values of a system, it can predict the dynamics of the system which it was not exposed to during training. It also predicts multistable dynamics of a system based on the initial condition for a particular parameter values.
  

* Research fellow: 2023-2025
  * Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS
  * Here I was exposed to infectious disease modelling and became interested in this field. We built a spatially extended bayesian heirarchichal model for the estimation of instantaneous reproduction number (R_t). It helps us understand how disease transmission dynamics in the connected regions is built by the mobile population with the regions.
